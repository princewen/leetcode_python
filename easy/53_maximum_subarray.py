"""

Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

For example, given the array [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
the contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

More practice:
If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
